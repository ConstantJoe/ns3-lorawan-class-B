# ns3-lorawan-class-B
Modifys imec iDLab's ns-3 implementation of LoRaWAN to include Class B mode

This is temporarily *not* a fork because I already have one fork of the imec ns-3 implementation.

The original repo can be found here:

https://github.com/imec-idlab/ns-3-dev-git/tree/lorawan

More tests, examples, and documentation coming soon.
